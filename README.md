# fitness App

## Why
I exported a week of fitbit data, and it seemed like a good opportunity to play around with CSS and transitions, which I've been meaning to explore.  I might clean up and/or fudge the data to make it more fun to display.  No javascripts were harmed in the making of this project - aside from collecting the data, it's 100% organic CSS.

## CSS Page Transitions
* default slide
* page specific fader in/out

## CSS Element transitions
* TODO
